## Python port (back burner)

Partial port exists in `pythonPDP/`. Not actively developed. `iac`, `pa`, and `bp` models are ported with 63/63 tests passing. Remaining models (`cl`, `cs`, `aa`, `ia`) are not yet ported.

## C version status

Terminal behaviour is working correctly on both Linux and Windows. No known issues.
